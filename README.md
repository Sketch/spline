# Getting the goods

## Prerequisites

Use apt or your favorite package installer to get those:

- Python3 (I assume 3.4)
- Python3-dev
- gcc
- git
- imagemagick
- libgit2-22 (Warning: this is in unstable in Debian, do not install libgit2-21 instead, pygit2 will fail to install if you do)
- libffi-dev
- libxslt1-dev
- libxml2-dev
- postgresql
- postgresql-client
- libpq-dev
- python3-pip

On Uubuntu, there is an extra step:
```
sudo pip3 install virtualenv --upgrade
```

Make a virtual environment and activate it:
```virtualenv-3.4 splineweb -p /usr/bin/python3.4```
(if you are in Vagrant's mounted folder on a non linux host: ```virtualenv-3.4 splineweb -p /usr/bin/python3.4 --always-copy```)
```
cd splineweb
source bin/activate
```

## Spline

```git clone https://github.com/Epithumia/spline```

## Floraverse

We'll start with a skin so you have something to look at
```git clone https://github.com/eevee/floraverse_com```

## SCSS files

```git clone https://github.com/eevee/archetype archetype.git```

# Prep the DB

First we'll create a new user
```sudo adduser splineuser```
Set his password (I'll use 'splinepw' for this example)

Next, we'll create a corresponding role in postgre (use "splinepw" when prompted for the new role)
```
sudo su - postgres
createuser splineuser -P
createdb -O splineuser splinedb
```

# Installing

Now ```exit``` to come back to your virtual environment
```
cd spline
../bin/pip install -e .
../bin/pip install colorama markdown pygit2 psycopg2
cd ../floraverse_com
../bin/pip install -e .
cd ../spline
```

## Initializing the db

We're almost ready. We need to create the database and populate it. You may want to change some parameters before running it, check them with
```
../bin/initialize_spline_db -h
```
We'll go with the defaults here
```
../bin/initialize_spline_db --db postgresql+psycopg2://splineuser:splinepw@localhost/splinedb -P spline_comic:comic -P spline_wiki:wiki -P floraverse_com:floraverse_com
```

# Run, Forr-- Spline, run !

Woo.
Now, start the server with
```
../bin/python spline --db postgresql+psycopg2://splineuser:splinepw@localhost/splinedb -P spline_comic:comic -P spline_wiki:wiki -P floraverse_com:floraverse_com --data-dir data 0.0.0.0:6543
```

## Adding an image

Open your browser and connect to http://localhost:6543 (or http://the_VM_IP:6543). you should get a message telling you something didn't work, which is normal at this point since you don't have any comic up, so go on and add one. First login at http://localhost:6543/@@auth/login (user = admin, password = test if you kept the default values) then go to http://localhost:6543/comic/@@admin
You should be able to choose an image from your computer, check "publish now" and fill a title and text then submit. Now it should appear in the archive and on the front page.

## Making our first wiki edit

You may have noticed that the "About" and "Contact" pages are blank. Let's fix that. Click on About, and then on create it. You'll have a big text field for you to write in, and a small text field at the bottom to write the edit reason in wiki fashion. In the main field, write down the following:
```markdown
Title: About

This site was made possible thanks to Spline, developped by Eevee and avalaible on [Github](https://github.com/eevee/spline).
```
In the reason box, write ```Initial version```.

Submit. Tada !

## Password change
If you want to change the admin password (I used https://www.dailycred.com/article/bcrypt-calculator to generate the test password):
```
sudo su - splineuser
psql splinedb < "update users set password = '<password encrypted with bcrypt here>' where id=1;
```
